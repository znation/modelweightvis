//! Architectural (structure-aware) layout for safetensors checkpoints.
//!
//! Every tensor is placed at its natural 2D element shape, 1 pixel per
//! element. Transformer blocks (`{prefix}.layers.{N}.{sub_path}`) share a
//! single canonical arrangement: each block draws every sub-tensor in the
//! same relative position. Blocks are arranged in a grid of `cols` columns
//! chosen to keep the overall canvas near-square (see [`pick_column_count`]);
//! within a column, consecutive layers stay pixel-aligned column-for-column,
//! so q_proj at row 0 aligns with q_proj at row 1 etc. Across columns the
//! alignment is broken but the visualization is no longer absurdly tall.
//! Top-level tensors (embed_tokens, lm_head, norms) sit above and below the
//! block grid, centred horizontally.
//!
//! The output canvas is queryable per tile via [`ArchLayout::regions_in_tile`].
