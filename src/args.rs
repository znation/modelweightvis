//! Tensor-aware CLI surface that flattens [`arbvis::Args`] and adds the
//! four model-side flags (`--moe-diff`, `--finetune` / `--no-finetune`,
//! `--diff-metric`, `--layout`).
//!
//! These four flags used to live on `arbvis::Args` directly, which meant
//! `arbvis --help` advertised them even though they only do anything when
//! a tensor-aware backend is registered (and the byte-only `arbvis`
//! binary errors out at runtime if the user actually passes them). After
//! the split they're owned here, so `arbvis --help` advertises only the
//! flags it can actually run, and `modelweightvis --help` advertises
//! both halves.
//!
//! Clap's `#[command(flatten)]` makes the two structs share a single
//! `Command`, so `--diff` (defined on `arbvis::Args`) and `--finetune`
//! (defined here) can reference each other in `requires =` / `conflicts_with`
//! constraints just as if they lived on the same struct. The cross-crate
//! visibility doesn't matter to clap — `arbvis::Args` derives `Parser` /
//! `FromArgMatches`, which is all the flatten machinery needs.
